# Key websites for reporting on nonprofits

### Internal Revenue Service:
[Tax Exempt Organization Search](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/tax-exempt-organization-search)

Available at this site:
* Form 990-N (e-Postcard) -- all 1.28 million nonprofits that file the e-Postcard
* Publication 78 -- list of 1.2 million organizations that can receive tax-deductible contributions
* List of 1 million organizations that have lost their tax-exempt status by failing to file Form 990
* Tax-exempt determination letters issued on or after Jan. 1, 2014

[Exempt Organization Master File](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/exempt-organizations-business-master-file-extract-eo-bmf)
* Four comma-separated-variable files listing virtually every tax-exempt organization -- not just those listed in Publication 78 that can receive tax-deductible contributions. Combine them to create a complete, or nearly complete, list of nonprofits. The complete file is about 320 MB. On import, be sure to specify that the first column, EIN (Employer Identification Number), is a character field since it often contains leading zeroes.

[Form 990 Series Downloads](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/form-990-series-downloads)

Available at this site:
* CSV index and zipped XML files of individual 990s by year from 2015 through 2020.
* CSV index and zipped PDF files of individual 990s by month from 2016 through July 2022.
* NOTE: It's relatively easy to find individual PDFs using the monthly index. The XML index appears to be virtually impossible to use unless you download, unzip and combine about 15 gigabytes of files into a single directory and then search the file names.

### Other websites:

[ProPublica Nonprofit Explorer](https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/)
* The best single source of 990s. Designed by journalists for journalists.

[Guidestar](https://www.guidestar.org/)
* The first and still one of the best online resources for researching nonprofits. Registration is free. You can search for a particular organization or, better yet, by size or even geography. Want to know the largest nonprofits in Nashville, where we're conducting this class? Guidestar can tell you.

[Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/?c_src=WPAIDSEARCH&gclid=CjwKCAiAioifBhAXEiwApzCztqmz24UXdSlBzFdUvlWoqQnLmaOMBCFAssaI5kjAp6rmtxOWrsdDWxoC0ngQAvD_BwE)
* Charity Navigator is the financial analyst of the nonprofit world, the one that digs into the numbers. Some critics question its narrow focus, but it's always worth a good look.

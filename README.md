This is the repository for an <code>R</code> class on analyzing nonprofit data, taught at the <code>NICAR Conference</code> in Nashville, March 4, 2023. 

The repo contains a tipsheet (Analyzing nonprofit data in R.md), links to helpful websites (Links.md), two R scripts, two extracts of 990 data plus an Excel data dictionary (21eofinextractdoc.xlsx), and a reference table of 990 forms and schedules (Form 990.md).

People using these materials after the conference should have the latest versions of R and R Studio plus the tidyverse, XML, xml2, readxl, and lubridate packages.

This is the repository for an <code>R</code> class on analyzing nonprofit data, taught at the <code>NICAR Conference</code> in Nashville, March 4, 2023. The repo contains a tipsheet, R scripts, data, links to helpful websites, and a reference table of 990 forms and schedules.

People using these materials after the conference should have the latest versions of R and R Studio plus the tidyverse, XML, xml2, readxl, and lubridate packages.

# Everyone should have both R and a suitable version of RStudio installed.

# Ubuntu users may need to prepare for the R libraries by installing some Ubuntu libraries:
# sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libfontconfig1-dev libharfbuzz-dev libfribidi-dev libfreetype6-dev libpng-dev libtiff5-dev libjpeg-dev libxml2-dev

# Everyone needs to run this:
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "httr", "readxl", "lubridate"))




# If you are unable to get things installed properly in time for the class, you may wish to try a hosted version of RStudio.
# Visit https://posit.cloud/
# You may find it fastest to create an account tied to your Google account
# Once you're in:
# - New Project button in the top-right corner
# - New project from Git repository (*not* new RSTudio project)
# - Git repository of https://github.com/roncampbell/NICAR2023
# In the command panel, paste in install.packages(c("tidyverse", "httr", "readxl", "lubridate"))     and hit Enter.

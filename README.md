This is the repository for an <code>R</code> class on analyzing nonprofit data, taught at the <code>NICAR Conference</code> in Nashville, March 4, 2023. 

The repo contains a tipsheet (Analyzing nonprofit data in R.md), extracts from 990 data and from the IRS Business Master File, a data dictionary of the 990s (21eofinextractdoc.xlsx), two R scripts, links to helpful websites (Links.md), a reference table of 990 forms and schedules (Form 990.md), and a list of codes used in the Exempt Organization Business Master File (EO reference.pdf).

People using these materials after the conference should have the latest versions of R and R Studio plus the tidyverse, XML, xml2, readxl, and lubridate packages.

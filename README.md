This is the repository for an R class on analyzing nonprofit data, taught at the NICAR Conference in Nashville, March 4, 2023. The file contains code, data, and links to helpful websites.

To get the data and code click on the "Branch: main" box next to the "New pull request" box and click on the choice "Data"; you'll then see the CSV files containing the data and the R script. People using these materials after the conference should have the latest versions of R and R Studio plus the tidyverse, XML, xml2, readxl, and lubridate packages.

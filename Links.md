# Key websites for reporting on nonprofits

## Internal Revenue Service:
[Tax Exempt Organization Search](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/tax-exempt-organization-search)
Available at this site:
* Form 990-N (e-Postcard) -- all 1.28 million nonprofits that file the e-Postcard
* Publication 78 -- list of 1.2 million organizations that can receive tax-deductible contributions
* List of 1 million organizations that have lost their tax-exempt status by failing to file Form 990
* Tax-exempt determination letters issued on or after Jan. 1, 2014

[Exempt Organization Master File](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/exempt-organizations-business-master-file-extract-eo-bmf)
* Four comma-separated-variable files listing virtually every tax-exempt organization -- not just those that can receive tax-deductible contributions. Combine them to create a complete, or nearly complete, list of nonprofits. The complete file is about 320 MB. On import, be sure to specify that the first column, EIN (Employer Identification Number), is a character field since it often contains leading zeroes.

## Basics

Nonprofits must file annual public reports, generally known as Form 990, with the Internal Revenue Service. The forms differ depending on the nonprofits' size and characteristics.

**Private foundations** draw most of their support from an individual or a family. Prominent examples include the Ford Foundation and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
**Public charities** get support from any of a variety of sources, including charitable donations and revenue from programs. Examples include universities, hospitals and social welfare groups.

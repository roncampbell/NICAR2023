## Basics

Nonprofits must file annual public reports, generally known as Form 990, with the Internal Revenue Service. The forms differ depending on the nonprofits' size and characteristics.

**Private foundations** draw most of their support from an individual or a family. Prominent examples include the Ford Foundation and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

**Public charities** get support from any of a variety of sources, including charitable donations and revenue from programs. Examples include universities, hospitals and social welfare groups.

## Forms

**990-N (e-Postcard)** filed by nonprofits with gross receipts less than or equal to $50,000.

**990-EZ** filed by nonprofits with gross receipts less than $200,000 and total assets less than or equal to $500,000.

**990** filed by nonprofits with gross receipts greater than $200,000 OR total assets greater than $500,000.

**990-PF** filed by private foundations regardless of the size of their gross receipts or total assets.

## Schedules

Except for those filing the barebones e-Postcard, most nonprofits must include supplemental schedules with their 990s. Here's a list of the schedules and the forms that they typically accompany:

* Schedule A - Public Charity Status and Public Support (990 or 990-EZ)
* Schedule B - Contributors (990, 990-EZ, 990-PF)
* Schedule C - Political Campaign and Lobbying Activities (990 or 990-EZ)
* Schedule D - Supplemental Financial Statements (990)
* Schedule E - Schools (990 or 990-EZ)
* Schedule F - Activities Outside the United States (990)
* Schedule G - Supplemental Information Regarding Fundraising or Gaming Activities (990 or 990-EZ)
